Piloting submarine
- "forward X" - increases horizontal by X
- "down X" - increases depth by X
- "up X" - decreases depth by X

Initial
- horizontal = 0 
- depth = 0

Task:
- Multiply final horizontal by final depth

Part 2:
- aim value = 0 initial

- "down X" increaes aim by X
- "up X" decreases aim by X
- "forard X" 
    - increasess horizontal by X
    - increases depth by aim * X
